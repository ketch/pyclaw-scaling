This repo contains scaling results for PyClaw.  The profiles are in 
subdirectories and can be conveniently analyzed using the `pyclaw_profiler.py`
script.  For instance:

    import pyclaw_profiler
    pyclaw_profiler.plot_and_table(ndim=2, solver_type='sharpclaw')

It's also easy to look at the profiles directly using pstats.  For instance:

    import pstats
    profile = pstats.Stats('./scaling200_3d_sharpclaw/statst_4096_1024_0')
    profile.strip_dirs()
    profile.sort_stats('tottime')
    profile.print_stats(10)

All of the profiles currently in the repo were generated by running
acoustics problems.

### To do:

 - Missing 3D SharpClaw run
 - 3D classic runs
 - 2D runs with more steps (so that the time is dominated by local computations)
 - Investigate poor scaling of max allreduce in 3D
 - Scaling tests on more complex problems (e.g., Euler)
